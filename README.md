# What is SpyenV2?

**SpyenV2** is a complete rewrite of the original [**Spyen**](https://github.com/Buzau16/Spyen) — a lightweight, code-only **game engine** built for developers who prefer full control and zero bloat.  
This version focuses on speed, modularity, and clean design, offering a solid foundation for building 2D (and potentially 3D) games entirely through code.
