# 🕹️ SpyenV2

**SpyenV2** is a complete rewrite of the original [**Spyen**](https://github.com/Buzau16/Spyen) — a lightweight, code-only **game engine** built for developers who prefer full control and zero bloat.  
This version focuses on speed, modularity, and clean design, offering a solid foundation for building 2D (and potentially 3D) games entirely through code.

---

## 🚀 Overview

SpyenV2 is designed for developers who want to *write games like they write code* — no drag-and-drop editors, no GUI clutter, just clean APIs and pure logic.  
It provides a minimal but powerful framework for:

- **Rendering** (2D graphics)
- **Input handling**
- **Game loop management**
- **Scene and entity management**
- **Resource management**

## 🔁 What's New in V2

Compared to the original **Spyen**, this rewrite introduces:
- 🧩 Modular architecture (plug-and-play systems)
- ⚡ Faster and cleaner rendering pipeline
- 🧠 Better separation of engine and user code
- 🧰 Modernized API (with consistency and extensibility in mind)
- 🧪 Easier debugging and logging
- 📦 Dependency-light core

---

## 🧱 Core Philosophy

> “Code is the editor.”

SpyenV2 rejects traditional game editor bloat. Everything — from scenes to assets to behaviors — is defined in code.  
This approach gives developers complete flexibility, better version control, and a deeper understanding of how their games run.
